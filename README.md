# Challenge: TEMPLATE_CHALLENGE_TITLE

This coding challenge is meant to evaluate how a TEMPLATE_POSITION approaches a problem and works through it. You can use your language of choice, and any resources you would normally use to do your job (Google, StackOverflow, documentation, etc.). The only disallowed action is looking up the exact problem (as applicable) and copy/pasting a solution. The challenge is intended to span 30-60 minutes, and the focus is not on whether you have a complete working solution in the time period, but instead on how you worked through the problem.
